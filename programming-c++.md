# Programming: C++

C++ is a compiled language. What you read and write is called **source code**, and what the computer executes is called executable, **object code**, or machine code. Typically object code files are given the suffix .o \(Unix\).

A program usually consists of several separate parts, often developed by different people. These separate parts must be linked together to form an **executable** program. Object code and executables are not portable among systems.
