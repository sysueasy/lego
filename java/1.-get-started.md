## Hello World

```java
/**
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
 */
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
    }
}
```

In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method whose signature is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

it's the **entry point** for your application and will subsequently invoke all the other methods required by your program.

Each string in the array is called a **command-line argument**.
