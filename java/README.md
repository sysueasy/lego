**Java technology** is both a programming language and a platform.

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the **.java** extension. Those source files are then compiled into **.class** files by the **javac** compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains **bytecodes** â€” the machine language of the **Java Virtual Machine**. The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java VM. Through the Java VM, the same application is capable of running on multiple platforms. 

The **Java platform** is a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. The Java platform has two components: Java Virtual Machine and Java Application Programming Interface \(API\). As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.

Java platform gives you the following features:

* Development Tools: **javac** compiler, the **java** launcher, and the **javadoc** documentation tool.
* API: The **API** is a large collection of ready-made software components that is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as **packages**.
* Deployment Technologies: The **JDK** software provides standard mechanisms such as the Java Web Start software and Java Plug-In software for deploying your applications to end users.
* User Interface Toolkits: The JavaFX, Swing, and Java 2D toolkits make it possible to create sophisticated Graphical User Interfaces \(**GUIs**\).
* Integration Libraries
