## NFC: Applications in 3 key areas

Reference: [https://nfc-forum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NFC-Real-World-II.pdf](https://nfc-forum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NFC-Real-World-II.pdf)

Three key areas of application for NFC: 

* Service initiation, where the technology is used to ‘unlock’ another service. By touching an NFC-enabled mobile phone against the NFC tag embedded in the poster, the user may be directed to a web site for further information or to book tickets.
* Peer-to-peer, where NFC is used to enable communication between two devices; For relatively **small** amounts of information \(_up to a few kilobytes_\), NFC can be used to transmit the data itself. However, for **larger** amounts of data, NFC is more likely to be used to _establish a separate wireless connection_ \(such as Bluetooth or WiFi\) to carry the content to be exchanged.
* Payment & Ticketing, where NFC will build on the emerging smart ticketing and electronic payment infrastructures.

## NFC: Device operates in 3 modes

In **Card Emulation** mode, the NFC-enabled device communicates with an external reader much like a traditional contactless smart card.

**Peer-to-peer** mode enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange information and share files. Peer-to-peer mode is standardized on the ISO/IEC 18092 standard.

In **reader/writer** mode, the NFC-enabled device is capable of reading NFC Forum-mandated tag types.

## NFC: Tag types

In June 2006, the NFC Forum introduced standardized technology architecture, initial specifications and tag formats for NFC-compliant devices. These include Data Exchange Format \(**NDEF**\), and three initial Record Type Definition \(RTD\) specifications for smart poster, text and Internet resource reading applications.

In addition, the NFC Forum announced the initial set of **four tag formats** that all NFC Forum-compliant devices must support. These are based on **ISO 14443 Types A and B** \(the international standards for contactless smartcards\) and **FeliCa** \(conformant with the ISO 18092, passive communication mode, standard\).

* Type 1 is based on ISO 14443 A and is currently available exclusively from Innovision Research & Technology \(TopazTM\). It has a 96-byte memory capacity.
* Type 2 is also based on ISO 14443 A and is currently exclusively available from Philips \(MIFARE UltraLight\). It has half the memory capacity of Type 1 tags.
* Type 3 is based on **FeliCa** and is currently exclusively available from **Sony**. It has a larger memory \(currently **2kbyte**\) and operates at a higher data rate \(**212kbit/s**\).
