# 4. Network Layer

Provide logical communication between hosts:

* on sending side, encapsulates segments into **datagrams;**
* on receiving side, delivers segments to transport layer.

Router examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it.

Two key network-layer functions:

* forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output.
* routing: determine route taken by packets from source to dest.

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

NAT: network address translation. Local network uses just one IP address as far as outside world is concerned.
