# 3. Transport Layer

A transport-layer protocol provides for **logical communication** between application processes running on different hosts. The transport layer converts the application-layer messages it receives from a sending application process into transport-layer packets, known as transport-layer **segments**. Application processes use the logical communication provided by the transport layer to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details of the physical infrastructure used to carry these messages.

Transport-layer protocols are implemented in the end systems but not in network routers. Whereas a transport-layer protocol provides logical communication between **processes** running on different hosts, a network-layer protocol provides logical communication between **hosts**. This distinction is subtle but important: 

* application messages = 快递
* processes = 收件人
* hosts = 收件地址（房屋）
* transport-layer protocol = 快递员
* network-layer protocol = 快递服务

Recall that the Internet, and more generally a **TCP/IP** network, makes two distinct transport-layer protocols: TCP \(Transmission Control Protocol\) and UDP \(User Datagram Protocol\).

Before introduce UDP and TCP, it will be useful to say a few words about the network layer. The Internet’s network-layer protocol has a name—IP, for **Internet Protocol**. The IP service model is a **best-effort** delivery service.

Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer **multiplexing** and **demultiplexing**, by using source and destination port-number fields in a transport-layer segment. Each port number is a 16-bit number, ranging from 0 to 65535. The port numbers ranging from 0 to 1023 are called well-known port numbers and are restricted for use by well-known application protocols.

Each socket in the host could be assigned a port number, and when a seg- ment arrives at the host, the transport layer examines the destination port number in the segment and directs the segment to the corresponding socket. The segment’s data then passes through the socket into the attached process. As we’ll see, this is basi- cally how UDP does it.
