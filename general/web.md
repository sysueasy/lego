### CSS Units

CSS has several different [units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) for expressing a length. Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc. There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

Absolute length units, cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc, are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout. Pixels \(px\) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel \(dot\) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

Relative length units, em, ex, ch, rem, vw, vh, vmin, %, scales better between different rendering mediums. The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout! \(Viewport = the browser window size.\)
