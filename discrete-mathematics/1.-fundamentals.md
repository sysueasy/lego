## Logic and Proofs

### Propositional Logic

Our discussion begins with an introduction to the basic building blocks of logic—**propositions**. A proposition 命题 is a declarative sentence \(that is, a sentence that declares a fact\) that is either true or false, but not both.

The **truth value** of a proposition is true, denoted by T, if it is a true proposition, and the truth value of a proposition is false, denoted by F, if it is a false proposition.

We use letters to denote **propositional variables** such as _p, q, r, s_, . . . . New propositions, called **compound propositions**, are formed from existing propositions using logical operators:

* The _negation_ of p, denoted by¬p.
* The _conjunction_ of p and q, denoted by p ∧ q.
* The _disjunction_ of p and q, denoted by p ∨ q. \(_inclusive or_\)
* The _exclusive or_ of p and q, denoted by p ⊕ q, is the proposition that is true when exactly one of p and q is true and is false otherwise.

The **conditional statement** p → q is the proposition “if p, then q.” p is called the _hypothesis_ and q is called the _conclusion_. It is false when p is true and q is false, and true otherwise.

When p is false, q may be either true or false, because the statement says nothing about the truth value of q. There are ways to express this statement:

* p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p
* “p only if q”, p cannot be true when q is not true
* “q unless ¬p“

We can form some new conditional statements starting with a conditional statement p → q.

* q → p is called the _converse_ 逆命题 of p → q
* ¬q →¬p is called the _contrapositive_ 逆否命题 of p → q
* ¬p →¬q is called the _inverse_ 反命题 of p → q

When two compound propositions always have the same truth value we call them **equivalent**, so that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are equivalent. The converse and the inverse of a conditional statement are also equivalent.

The **biconditional statement** p ↔ q is the proposition “p if and only if q.”  It's true when p and q have the same truth values, and is false otherwise.

### Logical Equivalences

A compound proposition that is always true is called a _tautology 永真式_. A compound proposition that is always false is called a _contradiction 矛盾式_.

Compound propositions that have the same truth values in all possible cases are called **logically equivalent**.

De Morgan laws:

* ¬\(p ∨ q\) and ¬p ∧¬q are logically equivalent.
* ¬\(p ∧ q\) and ¬p ∨¬q are logically equivalent.

### Predicates and Quantifiers

In this section we will introduce a more powerful type of logic called **predicate logic**.

We can denote the statement “x is greater than 3” by **P\(x\)**, where P denotes the **predicate** “is greater than 3” and x is the **variable**. Once a value has been assigned to the variable x, the statement P\(x\) becomes a proposition and has a truth value. In this case, P\(3\) is false and P\(4\) is true.

Predicates are also used to establish the correctness of computer programs, that is, to show that computer programs always produce the desired output when given valid input. \(Note that unless the correctness of a computer program is established, no amount of testing can show that it produces the desired output for all input values, unless every input value is tested.\) The statements that describe valid input are known as **preconditions** and the conditions that the output should satisfy when the program has run are known as **postconditions**.

**Quantification** expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. 

The **universal quantification** of P\(x\) for a particular **domain** is the proposition that asserts that P\(x\) is true for all values of x in this domain, denoted by **∀xP\(x\)**. Note that a single _counterexample_ is all we need to establish that ∀xP\(x\) is false.

The **existential quantification** of P\(x\) is the proposition “there exists an element x in the domain such that P\(x\).”, denoted by **∃xP\(x\)**.

The rules for negations for quantifiers are called De Morgan’s laws for quantifiers.

* ¬∀xP\(x\) is logically equivalent with ∃x ¬P\(x\)
* ¬∃xQ\(x\) is logically equivalent with ∀x ¬Q\(x\)

### Proofs

Formally, a **theorem** 定理 is a statement that can be shown to be true. We demonstrate that a theorem is true with a **proof**. **Axioms** 公理 are statements we assume to be true. A **conjecture** 猜想 is a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement.

## Basic Structures

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write **a ∈ A** to denote that a is an element of the set A.

These sets, each denoted using a boldface letter, play an important role in discrete mathematics:

* **N** = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of natural numbers（自然数/非负整数）
* **Z** = {. . . ,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}, the set of integers
* **Z+** = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of positive integers
* **Q** = {p/q \| p ∈ Z, q ∈ Z, and q = 0}, the set of rational numbers 有理数
* **R**, the set of real numbers（实数，有理数和无理数的总称）
* **R+**, the set of positive real numbers
* **C**, the set of complex numbers（复数）

\[a, b\] is called the closed interval from a to b and \(a, b\) is called the open interval from a to b.

The set A is a **subset** of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B.We use the notation **A ⊆ B** to indicate that A is a subset of the set B.

If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a **finite set** and that n is the _cardinality_ of S, denoted by \|S\|.

Given a set S, the **power set** of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P\(S\). If a set has n elements, then its power set has $$2^n$$ elements.

Let A and B be sets. The **Cartesian product** of A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all **ordered pairs** \(a, b\), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Hence, A × B = {\(a, b\) \| a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}.

We define the **truth set** of P to be the set of elements x in D for which P\(x\) is true. The truth set of P\(x\) is denoted by {x ∈ D \| P\(x\)}.

The **union** of the sets A and B, A ∪ B = {x \| x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}.

The cardinality of a union of two finite sets is \|A ∪ B\| = \|A\| + \|B\| − \|A ∩ B\|.

The **intersection** of the sets A and B, A ∩ B = {x \| x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}.

The **difference** 差集 of A and B, denoted by A − B, is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B, also called the **complement** 补集 of B with respect to A.

Computer Representation of Sets: Assume that the universal set U is finite. Represent a subset A of U with the bit string of length n, where the ith bit in this string is 1 if ai belongs to A and is 0 if ai does not belong to A.

### Functions

Let A and B be nonempty sets. A _function f_ from A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A, denoted by **f \(a\) = b**_._

If **f** is a function from A to B, we say that A is the **domain** of f and B is the **codomain** of f. We say that f **maps** A to B.

A function f is said to be one-to-one, if and only if f \(a\) = f \(b\) implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f. A function is said to be injective if it is one-to-one.

### Sequences and Summations

A **sequence** 序列 is a function from a subset of the set of integers to a set S. We use the notation $$a_n$$ to denote the image of the integer n. We call $$a_n$$ a term of the sequence.

A **recurrence relation** 递推关系 for the sequence {$$a_n$$} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence.

Using mathematical induction 数学归纳法, it can be shown that a recurrence relation together with its **initial conditions** determines a unique solution.

The Fibonacci sequence, $$f_0$$ , $$f_1$$ , $$f_2$$ , . . . , is defined by the initial conditions $$a = b$$ = 0, $$f_1$$ = 1, and the recurrence relation $$f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$$ for n = 2, 3, 4, . . . .

We say that we have solved the recurrence relation together with the initial conditions when we find an explicit formula, called a **closed formula**, for the terms of the sequence.

We use the **summation** notation: $$\sum^{n}_{j=m} a_j$$ to represent $$a_{m}$$ + $$a_{m+1}$$ + · · · + $$a_{n}$$ .

### Matrix

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m × n matrix. A matrix with the same number of rows as columns is called **square**. Two matrices are equal if they have the same number of rows and the same number of columns and the corresponding entries in every position are equal.

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11}&a_{12}&\cdots&a_{1n}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&\cdots&a_{2n}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ a_{m1}&a_{m2}&\cdots&a_{mn}\\ \end{bmatrix}$$
