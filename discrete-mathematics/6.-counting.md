# 6. Counting

We first present two basic counting principles, the **product rule** 乘法法则 and the **sum rule** 加法法则.

THE PRODUCT RULE: Suppose that a _procedure_ can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are $$n_1$$ ways to do the first task and $$n_2$$ ways to do the second task, then there are $$n_1n_2$$ ways to do the procedure.

THE SUM RULE: If a task can be done either in one of $$n_1$$ ways or in one of $$n_2$$ ways, where none of the set of $$n_1$$ ways is the same as any of the set of $$n_2$$ ways, then there are $$n_1 + n_2$$ ways to do the task.

THE SUBTRACTION RULE If a task can be done in either $$n_1$$ ways or $$n_2$$ ways, then the number of ways to do the task is $$n_1 + n_2$$ minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways.

The subtraction rule is also known as the principle of **inclusion–exclusion** 容斥原理, especially when it is used to count the number of elements in the union of two sets.

We illustrate the use of the **division rule** for counting with an example.
