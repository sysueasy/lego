# Probability

Although probability theory was originally invented to study gambling, it now plays an essential role in a wide variety of disciplines.

## Finite Probability

An **experiment** is a procedure that yields one of a given set of possible outcomes. The **sample space** of the experiment is the set of possible outcomes. An **event** is a subset of the sample space.

Laplaceâ€™s definition: If S is a finite nonempty sample space of equally likely outcomes, and E is an event, that is, a subset of S, then the **probability** of E is $$p(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}$$ .
