# 5. Induction and Recursion

Sets can be defined by listing some of their elements and giving rules for constructing elements from those already known to be in the set. Such definitions, called **recursive definitions**, are used throughout discrete mathematics and computer science.

## Mathematical Induction

In general, mathematical induction can be used to prove statements that assert that P\(n\) is true for _all positive integers_ n, where P\(n\) is a propositional function.

A proof by mathematical induction has two parts, a basis step, where we show that P\(1\) is true, and an inductive step, where we show that for all positive integers k, if P\(k\) is true, then P\(k + 1\) is true.

> In fact, mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering are all equivalent principles.

## Recursion

Sometimes it is difficult to define an object explicitly. However, it may be easy to define this object in terms of itself. This process is called **recursion**.

When we define a set recursively, we specify some initial elements in a _basis step_ and provide a rule for constructing new elements from those we already have in the _recursive step_. To prove results about recursively defined sets we use a method called **structural induction**.
