# 3. Number Theory and Cryptography

The part of mathematics devoted to the study of the set of integers and their properties is known as number theory 数论.

In the equality given in the division algorithm, d is called the **divisor**, a is called the **dividend**, q is called the **quotient**, and r is called the **remainder**. This notation is used to express the quotient and remainder: q = a **div** d, r = a **mod** d.

If a and b are integers and m is a positive integer, then a is congruent to b modulo m if m divides a − b. We say that **a ≡ b \(mod m\)** is a congruence and that m is its modulus \(plural moduli\).

> 17 is congruent to 5 mod 6 because 6 divides 17 - 5 = 12, 17 ≡ 5 \(mod 6\).

a ≡ b \(mod m\) if and only if _a mod m = b mod m_.

A **prime** 素数 is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible by no positive integers other than 1 and itself. A positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called **composite**.

Primes have become essential in modern cryptographic systems. The length of time required to factor large integers into their prime factors is the basis for the strength of some important modern cryptographic systems.

**The fundamental theorem of arithmetic**: Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are written in order of nondecreasing size.

THEOREM: If n is a composite integer, then n has a prime divisor less than or equal to $$\sqrt{n}$$ . \(This leads to the brute-force algorithm known as **trial division**.\)

The **sieve of Eratosthenes** is used to find all primes not exceeding a specified positive integer.

~~We will develop an important algorithm for computing greatest common divisors, called the **Euclidean** algorithm.~~
