# 4.1 Main Memory

Memory consists of a large array of bytes, each with its own address.

A typical instruction-execution cycle, for example, first fetches an instruction from memory. The instruction is then decoded and may cause operands to be fetched from memory. After the instruction has been executed, results may be stored back in memory.

## Hardware

**Main memory** and the **registers** are the only general-purpose storage that the CPU can access directly. Registers are generally accessible within one cycle of the CPU clock. Completing a memory access may take many cycles of the CPU clock.
