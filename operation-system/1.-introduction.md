# 1. Introduction

## What is Operation System?

An operating system is software that manages a computer’s hardware, acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware. A more common definition, and the one that we usually follow, is that the operating system is the one program running __at all times on the computer—usually called the **kernel**. Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs: **system programs**, and **application programs**.

**Mobile** operating systems often include not only a core kernel but also **middleware**—a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers.

A computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the **hardware**, the **operating system**, the **application programs**, and a **user**.

## Computer-System Organization

A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of **device controllers** connected through a common **bus** that provides access between components and shared memory. Typically, operating systems have a **device driver** for each device controller.

To understand how such a system operates, we focus on three key aspects of the system: interrupt, storage structure and I/O structure.

### Interrupt

Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the CPU, usually by way of the system bus. \(There may be many buses within a computer system, but the system bus is the main communications path between the major components.\) When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location. On completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation.

Interrupts must be handled quickly, as they occur very frequently. A table of pointers to interrupt routines is stored in low memory \(the first hundred or so locations\). This array, or **interrupt vector**, of addresses is then indexed by a unique number, given with the interrupt request, to provide the address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device.

We say that the device controller _raises_ an interrupt by asserting a signal on the interrupt request line, the CPU _catches_ the interrupt and _dispatches_ it to the **interrupt handler**, and the handler _clears_ the interrupt by servicing the device.

Figure 1.5 illustrates the design of the interrupt vector for **Intel** processors. The events from 0 to 31, which are **nonmaskable**, are used to signal various error conditions. The events from 32 to 255, which are **maskable**, are used for purposes such as device-generated interrupts.

The interrupt mechanism also implements a system of **interrupt priority levels**. These levels enable the CPU to _defer_ the handling of low-priority interrupts without masking all interrupts and makes it possible for a high-priority interrupt to preempt the execution of a low-priority interrupt.

### Storage Structure

In a larger sense, the storage structure consists of **registers**, **main memory**, and **secondary storage**.

The CPU can load instructions only from memory, so any programs must first be loaded into memory to run, called main memory \(also called random-access memory, or **RAM**\).

Computers use other forms of memory as well. For example, the first program to run on computer power-on is a **bootstrap program**. Since RAM is volatile, the computer uses electrically erasable programmable read-only memory \(**EEPROM**\) and other forms of **firmware** to to hold the bootstrap program and data. For example, the iPhone uses EEPROM to store serial numbers and hardware information about the device.

The basic unit of computer storage is the **bit**. A bit can contain one of two values, 0 and 1. A **byte** is 8 bits, and on most computers it is the smallest convenient chunk of storage. All forms of memory provide an **array of bytes**. Each byte has its own address.

A typical instruction–execution cycle, as executed on a system with a **von Neumann architecture**, first fetches an instruction from memory and stores that instruction in the **instruction register**. The instruction is then decoded and may cause operands to be fetched from memory and stored in some internal register. After the instruction on the operands has been executed, the result may be stored back in memory.

Most computer systems provide **secondary storage** as an extension of main memory. The most common devices are hard-disk drives \(**HDD**s\) and nonvolatile memory \(NVM\) devices. Other possible components may be **tertiary storage** like magnetic tapes.

### I/O Structure

Recall that a general-purpose computer system consists of multiple devices, all of which exchange data via a common bus. The form of interrupt-driven I/O described in [previous](1.-introduction.md#interrupt) is fine for moving small amounts of data but can produce high overhead when used for bulk data movement such as NVS I/O. To solve this problem, **direct memory access** \(DMA\) is used. Some high-end systems use **switch** rather than bus architecture. On these systems, multiple components can talk to other components concurrently, rather than competing for cycles on a shared bus. In this case, DMA is even more effective.

## Computer-System Architecture

On modern computers, from mobile devices to servers, **multiprocessor** systems now dominate the landscape of computing. The definition of multiprocessor has evolved over time and now includes **multicore** systems. In addition, one chip with multiple cores uses significantly less power than multiple single-core chips, an important issue for mobile devices as well as laptops. This characteristic puts pressure on operating-system designers—and application programmers—to make efficient use of these processing cores.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-11.17.54.png)

Here we show a dual-core design with two cores on the same processor chip. In this design, each core has its own register set, as well as its own local cache, often known as a level 1 cache. Lower-level caches are generally smaller and faster than higher-level shared caches.

Another type of multiprocessor system is a **clustered** system. They are composed of two or more individual systems—or **nodes**—joined together; each node is typically a multicore system. Such systems are considered **loosely coupled**. Clustering is usually used to provide **high-availability** service. The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware is called **graceful degradation**. Some systems go beyond graceful degradation and are called **fault tolerant**, because they can suffer a failure of any single component and still continue operation.

Since a cluster consists of several computer systems connected via a network, clusters can also be used to provide **high-performance computing** environments. The application must have been written specifically to take advantage of the cluster, however, this involves a technique known as **parallelization**, which divides a program into separate components that run in parallel on individual cores in a computer or computers in a cluster.

Cluster technology is changing rapidly. Some cluster products support thousands of systems in a cluster, as well as clustered nodes that are separated by miles. Many of these improvements are made possible by **storage-area networks** \(SANs\), which allow many systems to attach to a pool of storage. If the applications and their data are stored on the SAN, then the cluster software can assign the application to run on any host that is attached to the SAN. If the host fails, then any other host can take over. In a database cluster, dozens of hosts can share the same database, greatly increasing performance and reliability.

## Operating-System Operations

For a computer to start running, the bootstrap program must locate the operating-system kernel and load it into memory. Some services are provided outside of the kernel by system programs that are loaded into memory at boot time to become system **daemons**\(守护进程\), which run the entire time the kernel is running. Once this phase is complete, the system is fully booted, and the system waits for some event to occur.

If there are no processes to execute, no I/O devices to service, and no users to whom to respond, an operating system will sit quietly, waiting for something to happen. **Events** are almost always signaled by the occurrence of an **interrupt**. We described [hardware interrupts](1.-introduction.md#interrupt) in previous. Another form of interrupt is a **trap** \(or an **exception**\).

In a multiprogrammed system, a program in execution is termed a **process**. **Multitasking** is a logical extension of multiprogramming. In multitasking systems, the CPU executes multiple processes by switching among them, but the switches occur frequently, providing the user with a **fast response time**. In addition, if several processes are ready to run at the same time, the system must choose which process will run next. Making this decision is **CPU scheduling**.

Operating system must ensure that an incorrect \(or malicious\) program cannot cause other programs —or the operating system itself—to execute incorrectly. The approach taken by most computer systems is to provide **hardware support** that allows differentiation among various modes of execution. At the very least, we need two separate modes of operation: **user mode** and **kernel mode** \(also called **supervisor mode**, **system mode**, or **privileged mode**\). A bit, called the **mode bit**, is added to the hardware of the computer to indicate the current mode: kernel \(0\) or user \(1\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-15.14.43.png)

The concept of modes can be extended beyond two modes. For example, Intel processors have four separate **protection rings**. ARMv8 systems have seven modes.

We cannot allow a user program to get stuck in an infinite loop or to fail to call system services and never return control to the operating system. Before turning over control to the user, the operating system ensures that the **timer** is set to interrupt.
