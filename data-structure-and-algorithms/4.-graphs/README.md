# 4. Graphs

Graph theory, a major branch of mathematics, has been studied intensively for hundreds of years.

To illustrate the diversity of applications that involve graph processing, we begin our exploration of algorithms in this fertile area by introducing several examples.

## Scenarios

* Maps: A person who is planning a trip may ask questions like “What is the shortest route from Providence to Princeton?”
* Web content: When we browse the web, we encounter pages that contain links to other pages.  Graph-processing algorithms are essential components of the search engines that help us locate information on the web.
* Circuits: An electric circuit comprises devices such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors that are intricately wired together.
* Schedules: certain tasks cannot be started until certain other tasks have been completed.
* Commerce: Retailers and financial institutions track buy/sell orders in a market.
* Matching: Students apply for positions in selective institutions. We want to discover methods for matching interested students with available positions.
* Computer networks: We are interested in knowing about the nature of the interconnection structure because we want to lay wires and build switches that can handle the traffic efficiently.
* Software: A compiler builds graphs to represent relationships among modules in a large software system.
* Social networks: When you use a social network, you build explicit connections with your friends. Items correspond to people; connections are to friends or followers.
