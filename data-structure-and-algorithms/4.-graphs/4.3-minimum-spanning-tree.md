# 4.3 Minimum Spanning Tree

An **edge-weighted graph** is a graph model where we associate weights or costs with each edge. Such graphs are natural models for many applications. In an airline map where edges represent flight routes, these weights might represent distances or fares.

In this section, we consider **undirected edge-weighted graph** models and examine algorithms for one such problem: **Minimum spanning tree**. Given an undirected edge- weighted graph, find an MST. We examine two classical algorithms for computing MSTs: Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm.

Recall that a spanning tree of a graph is a connected subgraph with no cycles that includes all the vertices. A minimum spanning tree \(MST\) of an edge-weighted graph is a spanning tree whose weight \(the sum of the weights of its edges\) is no larger than the weight of any other spanning tree.
