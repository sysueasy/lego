# 4.4 Shortest Paths

Perhaps the most intuitive graph-processing problem is one that you encounter regularly, when using a map application or a navigation system to get directions from one place to another. A graph model is immediate: vertices correspond to intersections and edges correspond to roads, with weights on the edges that model the cost, perhaps distance or travel time. The possibility of one-way roads means that we will need to consider **edge-weighted digraphs**.

In this model, the problem is easy to formulate: Find the lowest-cost way to get from one vertex to another.

Beyond direct applications of this sort, the shortest-paths model is appropriate for a range of other problems, some of which do not seem to be at all related to graph processing. As one example, we shall consider the arbitrage 套利 problem from computational finance at the end of this section.
