# 2.1 Elementary Sorts

Our primary concern is algorithms for rearranging _**arrays** of items_ where each item contains a _key_.

## Selection Sort

* First, find the smallest item in the array and exchange it with the first entry.
* Then, find the next smallest item and exchange it with the second entry.
* Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted.

This method is called selection sort because it works by _repeatedly selecting the smallest remaining item_.

```java
public static void sort(Comparable[] a){ 
    int N = a.length; 
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
        // Exchange a[i] with smallest entry in a[i+1...N).
        int min = i; 
        for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++)
            if (less(a[j], a[min])) min = j;
        exch(a, i, min);
    }
}
```

Data movement is minimal: selection sort uses _N_ exchanges. None of the other sorting algorithms that we consider have this property.

## Insertion Sort

To sort bridge hands is to consider the cards one at a time \(from left to right\), inserting each into its proper place among those already considered.

For each i from 0 to N-1, exchange a\[i\] with the entries that are smaller in a\[0\] through a\[i-1\]. As the index i travels from left to right, the entries to its left are in sorted order in the array, so the array is fully sorted when i reaches the right end.

```java
public static void sort(Comparable[] a){ 
    int N = a.length;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++){ 
        for (int j = i; j > 0 && less(a[j], a[j-1]); j--)
            exch(a, j, j-1);
    }
}
```

## Shellsort

Insertion sort is slow for large un-ordered arrays because the only exchanges it does involve adjacent entries, so items can move through the array only one place at a time. For example, if the item with the smallest key happens to be at the end of the array, N-1 exchanges are needed to get that one item where it belongs.

Shellsort is a simple extension of insertion sort that gains speed. By h-sorting for some large values of h, we can move items in the array long distances and thus make it easier to h-sort for smaller values of h. Using such a procedure for any sequence of values of h that ends in 1 will produce a sorted array.
