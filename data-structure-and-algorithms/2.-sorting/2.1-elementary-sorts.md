# 2.1 Elementary Sorts

Our primary concern is algorithms for rearranging _arrays of items_ where each item contains a _key_.

## Selection Sort

* First, find the smallest item in the array and exchange it with the first entry.
* Then, find the next smallest item and exchange it with the second entry.
* Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted.

This method is called selection sort because it works by **repeatedly selecting the smallest remaining item**.

Data movement is minimal: selection sort uses N exchanges. None of the other sorting algorithms that we consider have this property.

## Insertion Sort

To sort bridge hands is to consider the cards one at a time \(from left to right\), inserting each into its proper place among those already considered.

## \*Shellsort

Shellsort is a simple extension of insertion sort that gains speed. By h-sorting for some large values of h, we can move items in the array long distances and thus make it easier to h-sort for smaller values of h. Using such a procedure for any sequence of values of h that ends in 1 will produce a sorted array.
