# 2.3 Quicksort

Quicksort is the sorting algorithm that is probably used more widely than any other. It is in-place \(uses only a small auxiliary stack\) and that it requires time proportional to $$NlogN$$ on the average to sort an array of length _N_.

It works by **partitioning** an array into two subarrays, then sorting the subarrays independently. Quicksort is complementary to mergesort: for mergesort, the array is divided in half; for quicksort, the position of the partition depends on the contents of the array.

```java
private static void sort(Comparable[] a, int lo, int hi) { 
    if (hi <= lo) return; // boundary
    int j = partition(a, lo, hi);
    sort(a, lo, j-1);
    sort(a, j+1, hi);
}
```

The crux of the method is the partitioning process, which rearranges the array to make the following three conditions hold:

* The entry `a[j]` is in its final place in the array, for some `j`.
* No entry in `a[lo]` through `a[j-1]` is greater than `a[j]`.
* No entry in `a[j+1]` through `a[hi]` is less than `a[j]`.

```java
private static int partition(int[] A, int lo, int hi) {
    int pa = A[lo]; //partitioning item
    int i = lo, j = hi+1; // i from left, j from right
    while(true) {
        while(A[++i]<pa) if (i==hi) break;
        while(pa<A[--j]) if (j==lo) break;
        if (i>=j) break;
        exchange(A, i, j);
    }
    exchange(A, lo, j);
    return j; // return partitioning index
}
```
