# 1.4 Analysis of Algorithms

## Scientific method

The process scientists use when trying to understand properties of the real world:

* **Observe** some feature of the natural world, generally with precise measurements.
* **Hypothesize** a model that is consistent with the observations.
* **Predict** events using the hypothesis.
* **Verify** the predictions by making further observations.
* **Validate** by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.

## Mathematical models

The total running time of a program is determined by two primary factors:

* The cost of executing each statement.
* The frequency of execution of each statement.

**Tilde approximations**: We write ~f\(N\) to represent any function that, when divided by f\(N\), approaches 1 as N grows, and we write g\(N\) ~ f\(N\) to indicate that g\(N\)/f\(N\) approaches 1 as N grows.

For example, we use the approximation `~N^3/6` to describe the number of times the if statement in ThreeSum is executed, since `N^3/6 + N^2/2 + N/3` divided by `N^3/6` approaches 1 as N grows. The **order of growth** is `N^3`.
