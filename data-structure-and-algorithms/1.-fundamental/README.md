The term algorithm is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

It is also important to recognize that a program in a particular language is just one way to express an algorithm.

Algorithms go hand in hand with data structuresâ€”schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.
