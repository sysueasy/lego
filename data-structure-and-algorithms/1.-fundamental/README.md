# 1. Fundamental

The term algorithm is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

It is also important to recognize that a program in a particular language is just one way to express an algorithm.

Algorithms go hand in hand with data structuresâ€”schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

We refer to the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our **programming model**.

A **basic model** for Java programming is to develop a program that addresses a specific computational task by creating a _library of static methods_, one of which is named `main()`.

**Modular programming**: we build libraries of static methods \(modules\) and a static method in one library can call static methods defined in other libraries.
