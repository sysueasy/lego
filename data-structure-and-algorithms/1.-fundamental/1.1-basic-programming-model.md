# 1.1 Basic Programming Model

We refer to the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our **programming model**.

A **basic model** for Java programming is to develop a program that addresses a specific computational task by creating a _library of static methods_, one of which is named main\(\).

**Modular programming**: we build libraries of static methods \(modules\) and a static method in one library can call static methods defined in other libraries.
