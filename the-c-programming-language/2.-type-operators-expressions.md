# Basic

## Hello World

The first program to write is the same for all languages:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) //arguments 参数
{
    printf("hello, world\n"); 
    return 0;
}
```

On the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file such as `hello.c`, then compile it with the command `cc hello.c`, make an executable file called `a.out`.

To run, type command `a.out`, in macOS, use `./a.out`.

## Tutorial

A C program, whatever its size, consists of **functions** and **variables**. A function contains **statements** that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. 

Our example is a function named **main**. Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but main is special, your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.

A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a **character string** or **string constant**.

An **escape sequence** like \n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters.

C provides **data types** including: `int, float, char, short, long, double`. The size of these objects depends on the machine you are using \(32-bit or 64-bit\). There are also `arrays, structures, unions` of these basic types, `pointers` to them, and `functions` that return them.

Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper _indentation_ and _spacing_ are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using _blanks around operators_ to clarify grouping.

In C, as in many other languages, **integer** **division** _**truncates**_: any fractional part is discarded, e.g 5/9 would be truncated to zero.

A `#define name replacement list` line defines a **symbolic name** or **symbolic constant** to be a particular string of characters, conventionally written in **upper case** so they can be readily distinguished from lower case variable names. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){ /* copy input to output; 1st version */
    int c;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        putchar(c);
}
```

`EOF` is an integer defined in `<stdio.h>`as a symbolic constant, its value is **-1**. In macOS, type `CTRL+D` in terminal to trigger EOF.

Any assignment in C is an expression and has a value, it can appear as part of a larger expression.

```c
/* copy:  copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */
void copy(char to[], char from[]) 
{
    int i;
    i = 0;
    while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
        ++i; 
}
```

You could instead write `c = c + 1` but `++c` is more concise and often more efficient.

By definition, `char` are just small integers. A character written between single quotes represents an **integer** value in the machine's character set, called a **character constant**. `'A'` is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65.

Since `main` is a **function** like any other, a return value of zero implies normal termination; non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions.

A **function** provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation, which can then be used without worrying about its implementation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore _how_ a job is done; knowing _what_ is done is sufficient.

In C, all function arguments are passed "**by value**". This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals.

## Type, Operators, Expressions

**Variable Names** are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter. The underscore "\_" counts as a letter. Don't begin variable names with underscore. Upper and lower case letters are distinct.

There are only a few **basic data types** in C: char, int, float, double.

In addition, there are a number of **qualifiers** that can be applied to these basic types.

* _short_ and _long_ apply to integers, int can be omitted.
* _signed_ or _unsigned_ may be applied to char or any integer.
* _long double_ specifies extended-precision floating point.

An integer **constant** like 1234 is an int. A long constant is written with a terminal l or L, as in 123456789L; 

Unsigned constants are written with a terminal u or U, and the suffix ul or UL indicates unsigned long.

Floating-point constants contain a decimal point \(123.4\) or an exponent \($$1e^{-2}$$ \) or both; their type is **double**, unless suffixed. The suffixes f or F indicate a float constant; l or L indicate a long double.

A leading 0 \(zero\) on an integer constant means octal \(八进制\); a leading 0x or 0X means hexadecimal \(十六进制\). For example, decimal \(十进制\) 31 can be written as 037 in octal and 0x1f or 0x1F in hex. 0XFUL is an unsigned long constant with value 15 decimal.

A **character constant** is an integer, written as one character within single quotes, such as 'x'.

The complete set of **escape sequences** is：

The character constant '\0' represents the character with value zero, the **null** character.

A **constant expression** is an expression that involves only constants. Such expressions may be evaluated at during compilation rather than run-time.

A **string constant**, is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes, as in "I am a string". Technically, a string constant is **an array of characters**. The internal representation of a string has a null character '\0' at the end, so the physical storage required is one more than the number of characters written between the quotes.

There is one other kind of constant, the **enumeration** constant. An enumeration is a list of constant **integer values**, as in `enum boolean { NO, YES };`The first name in an enum has value 0, the next 1, and so on, unless explicit values are specified.

Automatic variables for which is no explicit **initializer** have undefined \(i.e., garbage\) values.

The qualifier **const** can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specify that its value will not be changed. For an array, the const qualifier says that the elements will not be altered.

The binary arithmetic operators are `+, -, *, /`, and the modulus operator `%`. Integer division **truncates** any fractional part.

The relational operators are `>=, >, <, <=`. The equality operators are `=, !=`. Logical operators are `&&, ||`.

The unary negation operator `!`.

C provides two unusual operators for incrementing and decrementing variables. The expression `++n` increments n **before** its value is used, while `n++` increments n **after** its value has been used.

C provides six **bitwise** **operators** only be applied to **integral** operands. `&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~`.

The operator `+=` is called an assignment operator.

The conditional expression, written with the ternary operator `expr1 ? expr2 : expr3`.

When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a common type according to a small number of rules.

In general, the only **automatic** conversions are those that convert a narrower operand into a wider one without losing information, such as converting an integer into floating point in an expression like `f + i`.

Explicit type conversions can be forced in any expression, with a unary operator called a **cast**: `(type name) expression`.

## Control Flow

An expression such as `x = 0;` becomes a **statement** when it is followed by a semicolon.

Braces { and } are used to group declarations and statements together into a compound statement, or **block**.

The **if-else** statement is used to express decisions.

The **switch** statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and branches accordingly.

**While** and **for** loops test the termination condition at the top. By contrast, **do-while**, tests at the bottom after making each pass through the loop body; the body is always executed at least once.

A **break** causes the _innermost_ enclosing loop or switch to be exited immediately.

The **continue** statement is less often used; it causes the next iteration of the enclosing loop to begin. The continue statement applies only to loops, not to switch.
