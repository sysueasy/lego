## SDLC

The systems development life cycle \(SDLC\), which was introduced in Chapter 1, is a fundamental concept in the success of information system development projects.

In today’s diverse development environment, there are many approaches to developing systems, and they are based on different approaches to the SDLC. Although it is difficult to find a single, comprehensive classification system that encompasses all the approaches, one useful way to categorize them is along a continuum from predictive to adaptive.

A **predictive** approach to the SDLC assumes that the development project can be planned and organized and that the new information system can be developed according to the plan. Predictive SDLCs are useful for building systems that are well understood and defined.

An **adaptive** approach to the SDLC is used when the system’s requirements and/or the users’ needs aren’t well understood. In this situation, the project can’t be planned completely. Some system requirements may need to be determined after preliminary development work.

In practice, any project could have—and most do have—predictive and adaptive elements. That is why Figure 8-1 shows them as endpoints along a continuum, not as mutually exclusive categories.

The most predictive SDLC approach is called a **waterfall** **model**, with the phases of the project flowing down, one after another.

A little farther to the right on the predictive/adaptive scale are _modified waterfall models_. These are still predictive—that is, they still assume a fairly thorough plan—but there is a recognition that the project’s phases must overlap, influencing and depending on each other.

There are many ways to depict an adaptive SDLC. All include iterations. Rather than having the six phases proceed sequentially with some overlap, iterations can be used to create a series of mini-projects that address smaller parts of the application.

At the far right on the predictive/adaptive scale is the **spiral model**. It is generally considered to be one of the earliest conceptualizations of adapting the project based on the results ofeach iteration.

The adaptive approach presented in this textbook is a simplification of and variation on a more formal iterative approach called the **Unified Process** \(UP\).

A related concept to an iterative SDLC is called **incremental development**. Incremental development is an SDLC approach that completes portions of the system in small increments across iterations, with each increment being integrated into the whole as itis completed. Yet another related concept, which is also based on an iterative approach, is the idea of a **walking skeleton**.

The predictive waterfall SDLC explicitly includes a support phase, but adaptive, iterative SDLCs typically don’t. In fact, newer adaptive SDLCs consider **support** to be an entirely separate project worthy of its own support methodology. They begin only after the new system has been installed and put into production.

## Methodology

Aside from an SDLC, systems developers have a variety of aids at their disposalto help them complete activities and tasks. A system development **methodology** is a set of comprehensive guidelines for the SDLC that includes specific **models**, **tools**, and **techniques**.

Most of the models used in system development are graphical models, and the UML diagrams you have encountered so far in this book are examples.

Another important kind of model is a project-planning model, such as a **Gantt chart** or **net present value** \(NPV\).

Tools have been specifically designed to help system developers. Programmers should be familiar with integrated development environments\(**IDEs**\). **Visual modeling tools** are available to systems analysts to help them create and verify important system models.

Techniques are like gathering information, defining functional requirements, or user-interface design techniques as we discussed before.

All system developers should be familiar with two very general approaches to software construction and modeling because these form the basis of virtually all methodologies: the **structured** approach and the **object-oriented** approach.

## Agile Development

Agile development is a philosophy and set of guidelines for developing information systems in an unknown, rapidly changing environment, and it can be used with any system development methodology. Usually, Agile development _complements_ adaptive approaches to the SDLC and methodologies that support it.

## Project Management

The Standish Group categorizes projects in three ways: \(1\) successful projects, which are completed on time and within budget while meeting the users’ requirements for functionality; \(2\) challenged projects, which have some combination of being late, over budget, or reduced in scope; and \(3\) failed projects, which are cancelled or result in the system never being used.

Project management is organizing and directing other people to achieve a planned result within a predetermined schedule and budget.

A project manager works with several groups of people. First of all, there is the **client** \(i.e., the customer\), who pays for the development of the new system. Project approval and the release of funds come from the client. On the other hand, the **users** are the people who will actually use the new system.

Another dimension that has a heavy impact on project management is **ceremony**, the level of formality of a project; the rigour of holding meetings and producing documentation. Small projects are conducted with very low ceremony while larger projects are with high ceremony.

A project’s ceremony isn’t the same as whether its approach is predictive or adaptive. Adaptive projects can also be more or less formal in the way they are managed. The Unified Process\(**UP**\), is quite formal, with high ceremony. Each iteration is precisely defined, with such specific outcomes as specifications, diagrams, prototypes, and deliverables. The Agile approach is typically a low-ceremony approach.

The Project Management Institute \(**PMI**\) is a professional organization that promotes project management, primarily within the United States but also throughout the world. PMI has defined a body of knowledge for project management \(**PMBOK**\), a widely accepted foundation of information that every project manager should know. The PMBOK is organized into these nine knowledge areas: Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Human Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Integration.

## Core Process 1

To identify the business need and get the project initiated. There are several activities:

Identifying the problem: An effective way to define the problem is to develop a **System Vision Document**. There are three components to this document: the problem description, the anticipated business benefits, and the system capabilities.

Quantify the project approval factors: estimated time, estimated cost, anticipated benefits. Many organizations like to compare the estimated costs with the anticipated benefits to calculate whether the benefits outweigh the costs. This process is called a **cost/benefit analysis**. One popular approach is to determine the net present value \(**NPV**\) of the new system. The point in time when benefits offset costs is called the **break-even point**. The length of time before the break-even point is reached is called the **payback period**.

Performing risk and feasibility analysis: organizational, technological, resource, schedule.

Reviewing with the client and obtaining approval: After the executive committee approves the project, it goes to the board. After board approval, the IT department begins to assign full-time resources to the project. If the entire company knows that all the executives are supporting it and requesting cooperation, the project will proceed much more smoothly.

## Core Process 2

The activities that are necessary to get the project planned, scheduled, and started:

Establishing the project environment.

Scheduling the work: A **work breakdown structure** \(WBS\) is a list or hierarchy of activities and tasks of a project; used to estimate the work to be done and to create a detailed work schedule. **Gantt Chart** is a bar chart that portrays the schedule. The **critical path** is a sequence of tasks that can’t be delayed without causing the entire project to be delayed.

Staffing and allocating resources.

Evaluating work processes.

Monitoring progress and making corrections.
