# 3. System Design Activities

Systems design, is the bridge that takes us from requirements to solution. Analysis tells us what the solution needs to do, design describes how.

When aniterative approach to the SDLC is used, major design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many designed components are revisited during later iterations.

## Design activities

* Design the environment.
* Design application architecture and software.
* Design user interfaces.
* Design system interfaces.
*  Design the database.
* Design system controls and security.

Every software application must execute in some technology **environment**.This environment includes the computers and other hardware required for the deployment of the application as well as such things as server computers, desktop computers, mobile computers, firewalls, routers and cabling, fiber optics, and wireless access points.

Designing the application architecture is usually a top-down process, with the overall structure defined first and then the detailed design of the various subsystems.
