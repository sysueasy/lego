# 3. System Design Activities

Systems design, is the bridge that takes us from requirements to solution. Analysis tells us what the solution needs to do, design describes how.

When aniterative approach to the SDLC is used, major design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many designed components are revisited during later iterations.

## Design activities

* Design the environment.
* Design application architecture and software.
* Design user interfaces.
* Design system interfaces.
*  Design the database.
* Design system controls and security.

A key step in systems design is to classify the inputs and outputs for each event as either a system interface or a user interface. **System interfaces** are inputs and outputs that require minimal human intervention. **User interfaces** are inputs and outputs that more directly involve a system user.

## User Interface

From a user perspective, the user interface is the entire system. It is everything that the end user comes in contact with while using the system. Design techniques that embody this view of user interfaces are collectively called user-centered design, which emphasizes three important principles: 

* Focus early on the users and their work.
* Evaluate designs to ensure usability.
* Use iterative development.
