# 3. System Design Activities

Systems design, is the bridge that takes us from requirements to solution. Analysis tells us what the solution needs to do, design describes how.

When aniterative approach to the SDLC is used, major design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many designed components are revisited during later iterations.

## Design activities

* Design the environment.
* Design application architecture and software.
* Design user interfaces.
* Design system interfaces.
*  Design the database.
* Design system controls and security.
