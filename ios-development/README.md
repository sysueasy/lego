**Cocoa Touch** is a UI framework for building software programs to run on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS from Apple Inc.

The original code for the Cocoa frameworks came from the **NeXTSTEP** libraries Foundation and AppKit \(those names are still used by Apple's Cocoa frameworks\), and the NextStep engineers chose to prefix their symbols with NS.
