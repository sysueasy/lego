# Apple Inc

**Cocoa Touch** is a UI framework for building software programs to run on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS from Apple Inc.

**Cocoa** is Apple's native API for operating system macOS. The original code for the Cocoa frameworks came from the **NeXTSTEP** libraries Foundation and AppKit \(those names are still used by Apple's Cocoa frameworks\), and the NextStep engineers chose to prefix their symbols with NS.

## Transparency Report

Ref: [https://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/](https://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/)

Apple receives various forms of **legal** process requesting information from or actions by Apple. We receive requests from governments globally where we operate and from private parties.

Government request circumstances can vary from:

* law enforcement agencies are working on behalf of customers who have requested assistance locating lost or stolen devices
* law enforcement are working on behalf of customers who suspect their credit card has been used fraudulently to purchase Apple products or services
* an account is suspected to have been used unlawfully
* seek to preserve an Apple account, restrict access to an Apple account or delete an Apple account
* relate to emergency situations where there is imminent harm to the safety of any person.

Private party request circumstances generally relate to instances where private litigants\(诉讼当事人\) are involved in either civil or criminal proceedings\(民事或刑事诉讼程序\).

Any government agency seeking customer content from Apple must obtain a search warrant\(搜查令\) issued upon a showing of probable cause. If we determine a request does not have a valid legal basis, or if we consider it to be unclear, inappropriate or over-broad, we challenge or reject it.

When we receive an account request seeking our customers’ personal information, we notify the customer that we have received a request concerning their personal data except where we are explicitly prohibited by the legal process, by a court order Apple receives, or by applicable law.
