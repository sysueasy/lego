# Core Data

Use Core Data to manage the **model** layer objects in your application. It provides generalized and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object lifecycle and object graph management, including persistence.

Core Data reduces the complexity of creating and maintaining the model layer of your app. By using Core Data to define your data structures, you can remove most of the repetitive code that is typically required.

You use instances of [`NSManagedObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobject) as data structures, and you define the relationships between those objects using the data model.
