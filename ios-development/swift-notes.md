# Swift

## String

Swift structure[`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) is a [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html) string value that is a collection of characters.

The `String` type bridges with the Objective-C class `NSString` and offers interoperability with C functions that works with strings.

Strings always have **value** semantics\(rather than object\). Modifying a copy of a string leaves the original unaffected.

```swift
var otherGreeting = greeting // "Welcome!"
otherGreeting += " Have a nice time!" // "Welcome! Have a nice time!"
print(greeting) // "Welcome!"
```

Although strings in Swift have value semantics, strings use a **copy-on-write** strategy to store their data in a buffer. This buffer can then be shared by different copies of a string. A string‚Äôs data is only copied _lazily_, upon mutation, when more than one string instance is using the same buffer.

### Substring

Swift structure[`Substring`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/substring) is a type that represents substrings of a string while **sharing the original string‚Äôs storage**. Substrings present the same interface as strings.

```swift
let name = "Marie Curie"
let firstSpace = name.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? name.endIndex
let firstName = name[..<firstSpace] // prefix
```

By default, the Swift standard library [`~=`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#ID426) operator compares two values of the same type using the == operator. It can also match a value with a range of values, by checking whether the value is contained within the range.

```swift
let rawInput = "126 a.b 22219 zzzzzz"
let numericPrefix = rawInput.prefix(while: { "0"..."9" ~= $0 })
// numericPrefix is the substring "126"
```

When you need to store a substring or pass it to a function that requires a `String` instance, you can convert it by `String(numericPrefix)`.

 Each element of a string is represented by a [`Character`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/character) instance.

```swift
let cafe = "Cafe\u{301} du üåç"
print(cafe.count) // Prints "9"
print(Array(cafe)) // Prints "["C", "a", "f", "√©", " ", "d", "u", " ", "üåç"]"
```

### Unicode scalar value

A string‚Äôs `unicodeScalars` property is a collection of Unicode scalar values, the **21-bit** codes that are the basic unit of Unicode. Each scalar value is represented by a `Unicode.Scalar`instance and is equivalent to a UTF-32 code unit.

```swift
print(cafe.unicodeScalars.count) // Prints "10"
print(Array(cafe.unicodeScalars))
// Prints "["C", "a", "f", "e", "\u{0301}", " ", "d", "u", " ", "\u{0001F30D}"]"
print(cafe.unicodeScalars.map { $0.value })
// Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 769, 32, 100, 117, 32, 127757]"
```

### UTF-16

A string‚Äôs `utf16` property is a collection of UTF-16 code units, the **16-bit** encoding form of the string‚Äôs Unicode scalar values. These elements match those accessed through indexed `NSString` APIs.

```swift
print(cafe.utf16.count) // Prints "11"
print(Array(cafe.utf16))
// Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 769, 32, 100, 117, 32, 55356, 57101]"
let nscafe = cafe as NSString
print(nscafe.length) // Prints "11"
print(nscafe.character(at: 3)) // Prints "101"
```

### UTF-8

A string‚Äôs `utf8` property is a collection of UTF-8 code units, the **8-bit** encoding form of the string‚Äôs Unicode scalar values. This representation matches the one used when String instances are passed to C APIs.

```swift
print(cafe.utf8.count) // Prints "14"
print(Array(cafe.utf8))
// Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 204, 129, 32, 100, 117, 32, 240, 159, 140, 141]"
let cLength = strlen(cafe)
print(cLength) // Prints "14"
```

### String length

When you need to know the length of a string, you must first consider what you‚Äôll use the length for. Are you measuring the number of characters that will be **displayed** on the screen, or are you measuring the amount of **storage** needed for the string in a particular encoding?

For example, an emoji flag character is constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values:

```swift
let flag = "üá®üá≥"
print(flag.count) // Prints "1"
print(flag.unicodeScalars.count) // Prints "2"
print(flag.utf16.count) // Prints "4"
print(flag.utf8.count) // Prints "8"
```

To check whether a string is empty, use its `isEmpty` property instead of comparing the length of one of the **view**s to `0`.

## Hash

To use your own custom type in a set or as the key type of a dictionary, add [`Hashable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable) conformance to your type. The `Hashable` protocol _inherits_ from the [`Equatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable) protocol.

Hashing a value means feeding its essential components into a hash function, represented by the [`Hasher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hasher) type. `Hasher` can be used to map an arbitrary sequence of bytes to an integer hash value. Essential components are those that contribute to the type‚Äôs implementation of `Equatable`. Two instances that are equal must feed the same values to `Hasher` in `hash(into:)`, in the same order.

## Collections

Every array reserves a specific amount of memory to hold its contents. When you add elements to an array and that array begins to exceed its reserved capacity, the array allocates a larger region of memory and copies its elements into the new storage. Append operations that trigger reallocation have a performance cost, but they occur less and less often as the array grows larger.

Arrays, like all variable-size collections in the standard library, use copy-on-write optimization. This means that if an array is sharing storage with other copies, the first mutating operation on that array incurs the cost of copying the array. An array that is the sole owner of its storage can perform mutating operations in place.

A dictionary is a type of hash table.

## Control Flow 

A **switch** statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.

In contrast with switch statements in C and Objective-C, switch statements in Swift do not fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. If you need C-style fallthrough behavior, you can opt in to this behavior on a case-by-case basis with the **fallthrough** keyword.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The fallthrough keyword does not check the case conditions for the switch case that it causes execution to fall into. The fallthrough keyword simply causes code execution to move directly to the statements inside the next case \(or default case\) block, as in C‚Äôs standard switch statement behavior.
{% endhint %}

## Value and Reference Type

[Types in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=10) fall into one of two categories: first, ‚Äú**value types**‚Äù, where each instance keeps a unique copy of its data, usually defined as a `struct`, `enum`, or `tuple`. The second, ‚Äú**reference types**‚Äù, where instances share a single copy of the data, and the type is usually defined as a `class`.

## In-Out Parameters

Function parameters are constants by default. If you want a function to modify a parameter‚Äôs value, and you want those changes to persist after the function call has ended, define that parameter as an in-out parameter instead.

You place an ampersand \(&\) directly before a variable‚Äôs name when you pass it as an argument to an in-out parameter, to indicate that it can be modified by the function: `swapTwoInts(&someInt, &anotherInt)`

## Closure

[Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html) are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures can **capture** and **store** references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.

```swift
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in
    return s1 > s2
})
```

Swift automatically provides shorthand argument names to inline closures, which can be used to refer to the values of the closure‚Äôs arguments by the names `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

If you use these shorthand argument names within your closure expression, you can omit the closure‚Äôs argument list from its definition, and also the `in`keyword.

Single-expression closures can implicitly return the result of their single expression by omitting the `return` keyword from their declaration.

```swift
reversedNames = names.sorted { $0 > $1 }
```

## Enumerations

An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.

If you are familiar with C, you will know that C enumerations assign related names to a set of **integer** values. Enumerations in Swift are much more flexible, and do not have to provide a value for each case of the enumeration. If a value \(known as a ‚Äú**raw**‚Äù value\) is provided for each enumeration case, the value can be a string, a character, or a value of any integer or floating-point type.

**Associated value**: ‚ÄúDefine an enumeration type called Barcode, which can take either a value of upc with an associated value of type \(Int, Int, Int, Int\), or a value of qrCode with an associated value of type String.‚Äù

```swift
enum Barcode {
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int)
    case qrCode(String)
}
```

### Optionals

You use the Optional type whenever you use optional values, even if you never type the word Optional.

```swift
let shortForm: Int? = Int("42")
let longForm: Optional<Int> = Int("42")
```

The Optional type is an enumeration with two cases. Optional.none is equivalent to the nil literal.

```swift
let number: Int? = Optional.some(42)
let noNumber: Int? = Optional.none
```

## Structures and Classes

Structures and classes are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program‚Äôs code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your structures and classes. An instance of a class is traditionally known as an **object**. However, Swift structures and classes are much closer in functionality than in other languages, because of this, the more general term **instance** is used.

## Methods

Structures and enumerations are [value types](swift-notes.md#value-and-reference-type). By default, the properties of a value type cannot be modified from within its instance methods. However, if you need to modify the properties of your structure or enumeration within a particular method, you can opt in to **mutating** behavior for that method.

```swift
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
        x += deltaX
        y += deltaY
    }
}
```

## Initialization

Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers do not return a value.

```swift
init() { 
// perform some initialization here
}
```

When you assign a default value to a stored property, or set its initial value within an initializer, the value of that property is set directly, without calling any **property observers**. 

**Structure** types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers. Unlike a default initializer, the structure receives a memberwise initializer even if it has stored properties that do not have default values.

```swift
struct Size { 
    var width: Double
    var height: Double 
}
let twoByTwo = Size(width: 2.0, height: 2.0)
```

Swift provides a **default** initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself.

```swift
class ShoppingListItem { 
    var name: String? 
    var quantity = 1 
    var purchased = false 
} 
var item = ShoppingListItem()
```

Swift defines two kinds of initializers for **class** types to help ensure all stored properties receive an initial value. These are known as designated initializers and convenience initializers.

A **designated** initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the **superclass chain**. Classes tend to have very few designated initializers, and it is quite common for a class to have only one.

Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance‚Äôs initialization. This process, known as **initializer delegation**, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers. **Convenience** initializers are secondary initializers that call a designated initializer from the same class.

```swift
class Food {
    var name: String 
    init(name: String) { //designated
        self.name = name 
    } 
    convenience init() { //convenience
        self.init(name: "[Unnamed]") 
    } 
}
```

Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class that introduced it. The second phase is the opportunity to customize its stored properties further \(optional\).

Swift‚Äôs **two-phase initialization** is similar Objective-C. The main difference is that during phase one, Objective-C assigns zero or null values to every property. Swift‚Äôs initialization flow is more flexible in that it lets you set custom initial values.

Swift performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed, otherwise you will get _compile error_:

* A designated initializer must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.
* A designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property.
* A convenience initializer must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to any property.
* An initializer cannot call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.

![](../.gitbook/assets/initializerdelegation01_2x.png)

Once the top of the superclass chain is reached, and the final class in the chain has ensured that all of its stored properties have a value, the instance‚Äôs memory is considered to be fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete. Then in phase 2, working back down from the top of the chain, each designated initializer in the chain has the option to customize the instance further.

When you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass designated initializer, you are effectively providing an **override** of that **designated** initializer. This is true even if you are overriding an automatically provided default initializer.

Conversely, if you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass convenience initializer, that superclass convenience initializer can never be called directly by your subclass. As a result, you do not write the override modifier.

```swift
class RecipeIngredient: Food { 
    var quantity: Int 
    init(name: String, quantity: Int) { 
        self.quantity = quantity //new property introduced in subclass
        super.init(name: name) //delegates up
        self.name = self.name + "Ingredient" //assigning new value to an inherited property.
    } 
    override convenience init(name: String) { 
        self.init(name: name, quantity: 1) 
    }
}
```

Unlike subclasses in Objective-C, Swift subclasses do not **inherit** their superclass initializers by default. However, if you provide default values for any new properties you introduce in a subclass, then:

* If your subclass doesn‚Äôt define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.
* If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers‚Äîeither by inheriting them as per rule 1, or by providing a custom implementation‚Äîthen it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.

Write the **required** modifier before the definition of a class initializer to indicate that every subclass of the class must implement that initializer. You do not have to provide an explicit implementation of a required initializer if you can satisfy the requirement with an inherited initializer.

## Error Handling

Some operations aren‚Äôt guaranteed to always complete execution or produce a useful output. Optionals are used to represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it‚Äôs often useful to understand what caused the failure, so that your code can respond accordingly.

In Swift, errors are represented by values of types that conform to the [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error) protocol. This empty protocol indicates that a type can be used for [error handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html).

```swift
enum VendingMachineError: Error {
    case invalidSelection
    case insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: Int)
    case outOfStock
}
```

Throwing an error lets you indicate that something unexpected happened and the normal flow of execution can‚Äôt continue:

```swift
throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: 5)
```

There are four ways to handle errors in Swift.

1. Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions

```swift
func canThrowErrors() throws -> String
```

Any code that calls this method must either handle the errors‚Äîusing a do-catch statement, try?, or try!‚Äîor continue to propagate them.

2. Handling Errors Using Do-Catch

```swift
do {
    try buyFavoriteSnack(person: "Alice", vendingMachine: vendingMachine)
    print("Success! Yum.")
} catch VendingMachineError.invalidSelection {
    print("Invalid Selection.")
} catch VendingMachineError.outOfStock {
    print("Out of Stock.")
} catch VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(let coinsNeeded) {
    print("Insufficient funds. Please insert an additional \(coinsNeeded) coins.")
} catch {
    // the clause matches any error and binds the error to a local constant named error
    print("Unexpected error: \(error).")
}
```

3. Converting Errors to Optional Values

```swift
let x = try? someThrowingFunction()
```

4. Disabling Error Propagation

Sometimes you know a throwing function or method won‚Äôt, in fact, throw an error at runtime.

```swift
let photo = try! loadImage(atPath: "./Resources/John Appleseed.jpg")
```

## Protocols

A _protocol_ defines a blueprint of **methods**, **properties**, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be _adopted_ by a **class**, **structure**, or **enumeration** to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to _conform_ to that protocol.

In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can extend a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

**Delegation** is a **design pattern** that enables a class or structure to hand off \(or _delegate_\) some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type. This design pattern is implemented by defining a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities, such that a conforming type \(known as a delegate\) is guaranteed to provide the functionality that has been delegated. Delegation can be used to **respond to a particular action**, or to **retrieve data from an external source** without needing to know the underlying type of that source.

To prevent strong reference cycles, delegates are declared as **weak** references.

```swift
weak var delegate: DiceGameDelegate?
```

## Generics

_Generic functions_ can work with any type. The generic version of the function uses a placeholder type name \(called T, in this case, also called the _type parameter_\) instead of an actual type name \(such as Int, String, or Double\). The placeholder type name doesn‚Äôt say anything about what T must be, but it does say that both a and b must be of the same type T, whatever T represents. \(Swift is a _type-safe_ language\)

Swift enables you to define your own _generic types_, in a similar way to `Array` and `Dictionary`.

## Auto Reference Counting

In most cases, memory management ‚Äújust works‚Äù in Swift.

Whenever you assign a class instance to a property, constant, or variable, that makes a strong reference to the instance. ARC will not deallocate an instance as long as at least one active reference to that instance still exists.

If two class instances hold a strong reference to each other, such that each instance keeps the other alive. This is known as a **strong reference cycle**. You resolve it by defining some of the relationships between classes as **weak** or **unowned** references instead of as strong references.

A weak reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of the referenced instance. ARC automatically sets a weak reference to nil when the instance that it refers to is deallocated. So they are always declared as variables, rather than constants, of an **optional** type.

An unowned reference is expected to always have a value. As a result, ARC never sets an unowned reference‚Äôs value to nil, which means that unowned references are defined using **nonoptional** types.

Use an unowned reference only when you are sure that the reference always refers to an instance that has not been deallocated. If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that instance has been deallocated, you‚Äôll get a runtime error.

{% hint style="info" %}
Compared with system that use garbage collection, with ARC, values are deallocated as soon as their last strong reference is removed.
{% endhint %}

A situation where two properties, both of which are allowed to be nil, is best resolved with a weak reference.

```swift
class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
    var apartment: Apartment?
}

class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    weak var tenant: Person?
}
```

A situation where one property that is allowed to be nil and another property that cannot be nil is best resolved with an unowned reference.

```swift
class Customer {
    let name: String
    var card: CreditCard?
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class CreditCard {
    let number: UInt64
    unowned let customer: Customer
    init(number: UInt64, customer: Customer) {
        self.number = number
        self.customer = customer
    }
}
```

However, there is a third scenario, in which both properties should always have a value, and neither property should ever be nil once initialization is complete. In this scenario, it‚Äôs useful to combine an unowned property on one class with an implicitly unwrapped optional property on the other class.

```swift
class Country {
    let name: String
    var capitalCity: City! //default nil
    init(name: String, capitalName: String) {
    //as described in Two-Phase Initialization
        self.name = name //phase 1 completed
        //in phase 2, can start to reference the implicit self
        self.capitalCity = City(name: capitalName, country: self) 
    }
}

class City {
    let name: String
    unowned let country: Country
    init(name: String, country: Country) {
        self.name = name
        self.country = country
    }
}
```

A strong reference cycle can also occur if you assign a **closure** to a property of a class instance, and the body of that closure captures the instance. You resolve a strong reference cycle between a closure and a class instance by defining a **capture list** as part of the closure‚Äôs definition.

```swift
lazy var someClosure: (Int, String) -> String = {
    [unowned self, weak delegate = self.delegate!] (index: Int, stringToProcess: String) -> String in
    // closure body goes here
}
```

Define a capture in a closure as an **unowned** reference when the closure and the instance it captures will always refer to each other, and will always be deallocated at the same time. Conversely, define a capture as a **weak** reference when the captured reference may become nil at some point in the future.

## Memory Safety

A conflicting access to memory can occur when different parts of your code are trying to access the same location in memory at the same time. Multiple accesses to a location in memory at the same time can produce unpredictable or inconsistent behavior.

The conflicting access discussed here can even happen on a single thread and doesn‚Äôt involve concurrent or multithreaded code. For example:

```swift
var stepSize = 1
func increment(_ number: inout Int) {
    number += stepSize
}
increment(&stepSize)
```

Specifically, a conflict occurs if you have two accesses that meet all of the following conditions: At least one is a write access. They access the same location in memory. Their durations overlap.

An access is _instantaneous_ if it‚Äôs not possible for other code to run after that access starts but before it ends. Most memory access is instantaneous. However, there are several ways to access memory, called _long-term_ accesses, that span the execution of other code.

* A function has long-term write access to all of its [in-out parameters](swift-notes.md#in-out-parameters). 
* A [mutating](swift-notes.md#methods) method on a structure has write access to self for the duration of the method call.
* [Value types](swift-notes.md#value-and-reference-type) are made up of individual constituent values, mutating any piece of the value mutates the whole value, meaning read or write access to one of the properties requires read or write access to the whole value.

If the compiler can‚Äôt prove the access is safe, it doesn‚Äôt allow the access.

## Access Control

_Open access_ and _public access_ enable entities to be used within any source file from their defining module, and also in a source file from another module that imports the defining module.

_Internal access_ enables entities to be used within any source file from their defining module.

_File-private access_ restricts the use of an entity to its own defining source file.

_Private access_ restricts the use of an entity to the enclosing declaration, and to extensions of that declaration that are in the same file.
