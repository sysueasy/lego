J2ObjC is an open-source command-line tool from Google that translates Java source code to Objective-C for the iOS \(iPhone/iPad\) platform. The goal is to write an app's non-UI code \(such as business logic and **data models**\) in Java, which is then shared by web apps \(using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/)\), Android apps, and iOS apps.
